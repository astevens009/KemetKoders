# Coding Peer Review

### Reviewing Rules:
1. Be kind. The idea is to post postive and constructive feedback about the code posted
2. Don't just criticize the code, but also offer comments on what was <em>done right</em> in the code
3. Many of us learn best by <em>doing</em>, so rather than simply posting <em>your</em> solution to the problem post <em>suggestions</em> (i.e. - links to topics, or artictles that demonstrate solutions) to where to find solutions
4. If you do provide your own coding solution be sure to explain how you're code improves on the code you're reviewing
