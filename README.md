## Repository for coding buddies

### My vision for this repository - 

The goal of this repository is that it be a place where novice developers can connect with peers to practice for courses or coding interviews.

The goal here should be to get (and give) <em>guidance</em> toward solving coding exercises. If you are mentoring, be sure to <em>guide</em> your mentee to a solution (rather than just giving them the answer). If you are a mentee, and you are stuck be sure to ask <strong><em>just enough</em></strong> to get you unstuck and then continue trying to solve the coding exercise.
